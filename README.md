# Local file server for Sylvia TTS

This is supposed to be local file server that exposes local file DBs and static sound files from local server to trainer webapp.

By separating disk specific stuff from trainer webapp, the webapp can be cheaply deployed to any cloud platforms without worrying about disk spaces, etc.
